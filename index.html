			 <p>In today&rsquo;s fast-paced world, money moves quickly, and it can slip through your fingers like sand if you&rsquo;re not paying attention.

		<a href="https://logic2design.com/2025/08/08/automating-focus-one-shortcut-to.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2025-08-08 15:10:05 &#43;0800">Aug 8, 2025</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>When starting a new project, speed and structure go a long way. The less time spent setting things up, the more time you can spend actually moving things forward. That’s why I built a macOS Shortcut—powered by AppleScript—that automatically creates a new Focus folder across multiple tools I use every day: Finder, Apple Notes, Reminders, DEVONthink, Obsidian, and Apple Mail.</p>
<p>This shortcut supports my custom productivity framework, iCRAFT, and brings consistency to my entire workflow.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>🎯 What the Shortcut Does</p>
<p>When run, the shortcut prompts you to:</p>
<p>• Enter the name of your new Focus (project)</p>
<p>• Choose which apps you’d like to create folders for, all or a selection</p>
<p>Based on your selection, it will then:</p>
<p>• ✅ Create a new Finder folder for the project</p>
<p>• ✅ Create a new DEVONthink group</p>
<p>• ✅ Create a folder inside your Obsidian vault</p>
<p>• ✅ Generate a new Reminder list, either standard or from a pre-defined template</p>
<p>• ✅ Create an optional Apple Note that includes links to all the above folders</p>
<p>• ✅ Set up a new folder in Apple Mail named after the project</p>
<p>Everything is named consistently, placed in the right locations, and opened if needed. It’s a unified launchpad for any type of project.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>🗂️ Reminders: Template or New List</p>
<p>For Reminders, you get two options:</p>
<ol>
<li>Start with a blank list named after your project</li>
<li>Duplicate a template list—for example, I use a Focus Template that’s structured as a Kanban board, with sections like Backlog, In Progress, Blocked, Review and Done</li>
</ol>
<p>This allows you to hit the ground running with a workflow that matches your needs—especially helpful for task-heavy projects.</p>
<p>Reminders - Focus.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>📝 The Apple Note Hub (Optional)</p>
<p>If you choose to create an Apple Note, it acts as a lightweight dashboard. The note includes direct links to:</p>
<p>• 📂 The Finder folder</p>
<p>• 📁 The DEVONthink folder</p>
<p>• 📂 The Obsidian project folder</p>
<p>• ✅ The new Reminders list</p>
<p>• ✉️ Apple Mail</p>
<p>This makes it easy to jump between tools without hunting for the right folder each time. Of course, you can skip this step if you prefer to work app-first rather than note-first.</p>
<p>Apple Notes Hub</p>
<p><img src="https://logic2design.com/uploads/2025/notes-hub.png" alt=""></p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>📬 Creating a Mail Folder</p>
<p>The Shortcut creates a new folder within your Mail app, named after the Focus. This is ideal for:</p>
<p>• Client-based projects</p>
<p>• Ongoing discussions</p>
<p>• Organising messages by topic or deliverable</p>
<p>Once created, the Mail folder is ready to receive new messages or manually filed emails—keeping your inbox clean and your project communications contained.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>🧱 Designed for iCRAFT</p>
<p>This shortcut is fully integrated into my <a href="https://logic2design.com/2025/07/12/productivity-isnt-onesizefitsallits-crafted.html">iCRAFT system</a>, a structured and actionable take on Tiago Forte’s <a href="https://fortelabs.com/blog/para/">PARA</a> method. Here’s a quick look:</p>
<p>• Inbox – Capture everything, no judgment</p>
<p>• Categories – Core areas like Business, Personal, Work, etc.</p>
<p>• Resources – Articles, snippets, and reference materials</p>
<p>• Assets – Templates, code snippets, and reusable content</p>
<p>• Focus – Projects that are active and moving</p>
<p>• Trove – Archived Focus projects for future reference</p>
<p>This shortcut automates setup within the Focus layer, keeping everything coordinated from the start.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>💻 Mac-Only, Powered by AppleScript</p>
<p>Because it relies on AppleScript, this shortcut is macOS-only. But that also means it’s fast, local, and fully integrated into the Apple ecosystem. There are no third-party dependencies—just native automation using tools already on your Mac.</p>
<p>It’s especially useful for those who rely on DEVONthink, Obsidian, and Reminders to manage knowledge, tasks, and workflows.</p>
<p>You just need to set the parameters in the script to suit your needs</p>
<p><img src="https://logic2design.com/uploads/2025/preferences.png" alt=""></p>
<p>If you don’t have, or want, all of the apps the script covers you just change the following settings to false</p>
<p><img src="https://logic2design.com/uploads/2025/app-selection.png" alt=""></p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>🧪 Example: New Focus in Action</p>
<p>Let’s say I’m starting a new training course. I would</p>
<ol>
<li>Trigger the shortcut and enter “Building a 2nd Brain”</li>
<li>Choose to create:</li>
</ol>
<p>• Finder folder ✅</p>
<p>• DEVONthink group ✅</p>
<p>• Obsidian folder ✅</p>
<p>• Reminder list (using my Kanban-style template) ✅</p>
<p>• Apple Note ✅</p>
<p>• Mail folder ✅</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>The shortcut does the rest: creates folders, adds links, and gets everything ready.</li>
</ol>
<p>Within seconds, I have a consistent, structured workspace for the project—across every app I use to manage it.</p>
<p>Here is a video that includes a demonstration of the generation of the folders</p>

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
  <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xpipIR3idn4" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;" allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe>
</div>

<p>⸻</p>
<p>🔁 Reusable, Repeatable, Reliable</p>
<p>This shortcut has become my go-to method for launching new projects. It reduces setup time, prevents folder chaos, and ensures I start every Focus with the same solid foundation.</p>
<p>If you’re a Mac user juggling multiple tools, I highly recommend setting something like this up. My process is available via Gumroad for <a href="https://logic2design.gumroad.com/l/sivzel">$5</a>, or via a membership to my suite of Apple Product focussed Shortcuts for only <a href="https://logic2design.gumroad.com/l/xnopsi">$10</a>.</p>
<p>When everything starts in the same way, you can focus on the work—not finding your files.</p>

Adjustments can be made on the fly, adding to the convenience.</p>
<p><strong>4. Extensive Material Library:</strong>

			 <h4 id="introduction">Introduction</h4>
<p>A natural progression from my 3d printing hobby was to look at acquiring a laser engraver. My preference is to buy into an ecosystem, where the hardware and software is tightly aligned, such as market leaders Apple and Bambu Lab. My other preference was an enclosed design. I looked at offers from Creality and RoIy Automation but there were issues with quality of design and materials or reliance on third party software that could leave you stranded and limits the potential for feature improvements.</p>
<h4 id="xtools-the-obvious-choice">XTools: The obvious choice</h4>
<p>In the end I chose the XTool S1 Enclosed Laser as it met all my requirements, plus its beautiful design gained Wife approval 😀, the other options are not so easy on the eye . Praised for its innovation and safety features, the S1 model is tailor-made for users who demand precision, efficiency, and reliability. In this deep dive, we will explore the multifaceted advantages of the XTool S1, highlighting why it&rsquo;s a leading choice in the laser engraving industry.</p>
<p><img src="https://logic2design.com/uploads/2025/xtoolsd-s1.jpg" alt="XTool S1 Laser"></p>
<h4 id="safety-first-a-closed-design-that-cares">Safety First: A Closed Design That Cares</h4>
<p>One of the standout features of the XTool S1 is its enclosed design. This isn’t just about aesthetics; it’s about safety. Laser engravers, by nature, can be dangerous. The enclosed casing of the XTool S1 significantly reduces the risks associated with direct exposure to the laser beam. This design not only protects the user from accidental exposure but also helps in containing the fumes and particles produced during the engraving process. It’s especially beneficial in educational settings or home environments where safety is a paramount concern.</p>
<h4 id="precision-and-power-unmatched-quality">Precision and Power: Unmatched Quality</h4>
<p>At the heart of the XTool S1&rsquo;s appeal is its extraordinary precision. Equipped with a high-quality laser, this machine can achieve detailed engravings on a variety of materials, from wood and leather to some metals and plastics. What sets it apart is the consistency of the results, whether you&rsquo;re working on intricate designs for jewellery or customising industrial components. The S1’s robust construction minimises vibrations, ensuring that even the most delicate work is sharp and clear.</p>
<h4 id="user-friendly-experience-easy-does-it">User-Friendly Experience: Easy Does It</h4>
<p>Another significant advantage of the XTool S1 is its user-friendliness. It is designed not just for skilled artisans but also for beginners. The setup process is straightforward, and the learning curve is gentle, thanks to its intuitive software interface. The software supports multiple file formats, allowing users to effortlessly import designs or create them in the application. Furthermore, the XTool S1 provides real-time previews, which means users can see exactly how their designs will look before the engraving begins. This feature saves time and materials by reducing errors.</p>

			 <p>Revolutionising the Industry with Innovative Technology</p>
<p>I first got into 3d printing while helping a family member put together a <a href="https://www.prusa3d.com/category/original-prusa-mini/">Prusa Mini </a>knockoff. kit. That process was not enjoyable and the finished product was lack lustere in performance, but it tweaked my interest in the 3d printing world,</p>
<p>I then bought a <a href="https://flashforge-au.com/products/adventurer-3">FlashForge Adventurer 3 </a>and used it successfully for several years. That printer worked well but it was slow and the build dimensions limited my options with what models I could print.</p>
<p>From afar I observed that Bambu Lab was swiftly rising to prominence in the 3D printing world, thanks to its relentless pursuit of innovation. Founded by a team of passionate engineers and designers, the company aims to make 3D printing more accessible, efficient, and versatile for users at all levels. What sets Bambu Labs apart is not just the quality of its printers but also the sophisticated software that drives them, alongside revolutionary features like the Automatic Material Switching (AMS) system.</p>
<p>The P1S: A Beacon of Quality and Performance</p>
<p>At the heart of Bambu Labs’ product line is the <a href="https://au.store.bambulab.com/products/p1s?srsltid=AfmBOorEPbokjjxwW4Au1CmQCLWf-jshFK-%5B%5B%5D()%5D()yMZvBJeDAJPDK4AqyAnt0">Bambu Labs P1S</a>, a fully enclosed 3D printer that embodies the company&rsquo;s commitment to excellence. Known for its remarkable speed and precision, the P1S is powered by proprietary technology that optimises print time without compromising on detail or quality. Its features include:</p>
<p>High-Speed Printing: Utilising a unique X/Y core motion system, the P1S can print at speeds unheard of in similarly priced models.
Precision Printing: Advanced extrusion technology ensures that every layer of your print is exact, reducing the need for post-processing.</p>
<p>These features make the P1S not just a tool, but a gateway to exploring the possibilities of 3D printing.</p>
<p>Software Superiority: Simplifying Complexity</p>
<p>What really elevates Bambu Labs above the competition is its integrated software solutions. These are designed to enhance the user experience, streamline the printing process, and unlock new potentials in 3D design. The software suite offers:</p>

Seamless Integration: From design software to the printing interface, everything works together flawlessly, ensuring a smooth workflow.
Regular Updates: Bambu Labs is committed to continuous improvement, frequently releasing software updates that enhance functionality and user experience.</p>
<p>Automatic Material Switching (AMS): A Game Changer</p>
<p>Perhaps the most revolutionary feature offered by Bambu Labs is the Automatic Material Switching (AMS) system. This system allows users to automatically switch between different types of filament during a single print job, which can significantly enhance the creative capabilities of any designer. The AMS is particularly useful for:</p>
<p>Complex Multi-Material Projects: Easily switch between different materials to achieve varied textures and strengths within a single object.
High-Volume Printing Operations: Reduce downtime by automatically switching to a new filament spool when one runs out.
Enhanced Color Options: Create vibrant, coloured objects without manual intervention.</p>
<p>Community Support: Ongoing Improvement
As good as the design of the P1S is there is always room for improvement. One of the beauties of the 3D printing scene is the development and availability of community modifications. In my case I have enhanced the P1S with the following modifications</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/xperiments-in/xtouch">Xtouch LCD Screen</a> - Duplicates a lot of the functions of the big brother X1 Carbon’s screen.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
